create a cluster:
In ECS → Task Definitions → Create New Task Definition:
Launch type: Fargate
Task name: java-ecr-demo-task
Task role: Use default or create one
Container definition:
Container name: java-ecr-demo

Image:
[your_account_id].dkr.ecr.[region].amazonaws.com/java-ecr-dev-repo:dev
Port mappings: 8080 (or whatever your app uses)
CPU/Memory: e.g., 0.5 vCPU, 1 GB

**Create a Service
**
Go to your ECS Cluster → Services → Create
Launch type: Fargate
Task definition: java-ecr-demo-task
Service name: java-ecr-demo-service
Desired tasks: 1
Cluster: java-ecr-demo-cluster
Networking:
VPC: Choose default or custom
Subnets: Select public subnets
Security Group: Allow inbound on 8080 (or your port)
✅ Once deployed, you can see your app running under "Tasks".

**4. (Optional) Add an ALB (Load Balancer)
**
If you want public access:
Create an Application Load Balancer
Forward requests to your ECS service
Point DNS to the ALB's public DNS

**Automate Deployment (Optional)
**
You can add ECS deployment into your GitHub Actions workflow using:

yaml

- name: Deploy to ECS
  uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
  with:
    task-definition: task-def.json
    service: java-ecr-demo-service
    cluster: java-ecr-demo-cluster
    wait-for-service-stability: true
You'd need to generate a task-def.json dynamically or store a base version in your repo.
